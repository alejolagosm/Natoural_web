# Landing page in Spanish for a tour agency

This is a static webpage for a tour agency. Made using only HTML and SCSS.

There are some cool properties and effects:

- Creating grids using only floats
- A navigation with a hamburguer menu that pops up with the help of a checkbox input
- Clip paths to make cool background effects
- Animations for the buttons and visibility effects
- Flotted images composition with a hover animation
- A skewed row of cards
- Using backface-visibility to make rotating cards with a front and back
- Making a popup window only with CSS using the "target" state
- Cool text effect that flows around a round image (Not fully supported by Chrome)
- A nice form with background and special radio buttons using a span element
- Fully responsive for phone and tablets
- Media queries for responsive images (in HTML and CSS) to improve the performance of the website
- -webkit- and @supports for very new CSS properties.
- Using the ::selection element to change the default style when the user selects text from the page

Other new tools:

- Made a build process for development in the package.json file, that means to join several scripts to run

Functionalities pending to apply with JS:

- The popups do not have working links for other pages
- The card pop up doesnÂ´t close when you click outside of it
